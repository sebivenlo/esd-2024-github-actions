# GitHub Actions vs. Jenkins: A Comparative Guide


## Introduction

Choosing the right Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tool is crucial to streamlining development workflows (Safe, 2023). 
*Jenkins* is a well known, self-hosted automation server with a rich ecosystem of plugins. 
*GitHub Actions*, on the other hand, integrates natively with GitHub, providing a convenient way to build, test, and deploy applications or infrastructure (Dinu, 2024).

## 1. Platform Overview

| Feature                 | Jenkins                                                                                  | GitHub Actions                                                                                         |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Hosting*             | Self-hosted (Safe, 2023; Dinu, 2024).                                                    | cloud-hosted (Safe, 2023; Dinu, 2024).                                                                 |
| *Setup*               | Reqiures manual installation and instance creation (Dinu, 2024).                         | No installation. Simple setup with YAML workflows (Safe, 2023; Dinu, 2024).                            |
| *Extensibility*       | Large plugin ecosystem for customization (Safe, 2023).                                   | Extensive marketplace of reusable Actions (Safe, 2023).                                                |
| *Integration*         | Integrates with many tools and services through plugins (Safe, 2023).                    | Native integration with GitHub repositories and events (Safe, 2023; Dinu, 2024).                       |
| *Execution Model*     | Primarily polling-based, event-driven through webhooks/plugins (Safe, 2023; Dinu, 2024). | Event-driven by default (e.g., triggered on push or pull_request) (Safe, 2023; Dinu, 2024).            |
| *Programming Language Support* | Supports multiple languages through plugins (Safe, 2023).                                | Supports multiple languages natively through predefined and custom Actions (Safe, 2023).               |
| *Scaling*             | Requires manual scaling and infrastructure management (Dinu, 2024).                      | Scales automatically with GitHub-hosted runners (Safe, 2023; Dinu, 2024).                              |
| *Cost*                | Free for self-hosted setups; costs depend on infrastructure (Dinu, 2024).                | Free for public repositories; usage fees for private repositories with large-scale usage (Dinu, 2024). |

## 2. Configuration Language

- *Jenkins*: Utilizes Groovy-based pipelines for defining build stages and logic (Safe, 2023).
- *GitHub Actions*: Uses YAML, triggering workflows on GitHub events (Dinu, 2024).

| Aspect                   | Jenkins (Groovy DSL)                                       | GitHub Actions (YAML)                                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Learning Curve*       | Steeper, especially for beginners (Safe, 2023).            | Generally easier and more familiar to Github users (Dinu, 2024).          |
| *Customization*        | Extensive plugin usage and custom scripts (Safe, 2023).    | Leverage official or community Actions (Dinu, 2024).                    |
| *Syntax & Readability* | Can be powerful but complex (Safe, 2023).                  | Often simpler, especially for GitHub-centric teams (Dinu, 2024).        |

## 3. Ecosystem and Extendability

### Jenkins Ecosystem
- *Plugins*: Widely recognized for its vast plugin ecosystem, covering a range of integrations (Safe, 2023).
- *Community Support*: Large community presence for troubleshooting (Dinu, 2024).
- *Downside*: With many plugins, maintenance can become cumbersome (Safe, 2023).

### GitHub Actions Ecosystem
- *Marketplace*: Offers a variety of prebuilt and community-maintained Actions (Dinu, 2024).
- *Reusability*: Users can create custom or shared Actions to standardize tasks (Safe, 2023).
- *Downside*: Overall plugin/Action library may be smaller than Jenkins but is growing rapidly (Dinu, 2024).

## 4. Scalability and Hosting

| Feature              | GitHub Actions                                          | Jenkins                                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| *Hosting Model*    | SaaS by default (GitHub-hosted runners) or self-hosted | Always self-hosted                                        |
| *Scaling*          | Auto-scaling on GitHub’s infrastructure                | Manual scaling of servers and executors (Dinu, 2024)      |
| *Maintenance*      | Minimal for hosted; more for self-hosted runners       | Requires ongoing maintenance of servers/containers (Safe, 2023) |

- *GitHub Actions*: For large private repositories, usage fees may rise with heavy usage (Dinu, 2024).
- *Jenkins*: Being open-source, the software is free, but the cost and labor of infrastructure can add up (Safe, 2023).

---

## 5. Security Considerations

- *Jenkins*
    - Must handle security configurations on the self-hosted instance (Dinu, 2024).
    - Plugin vulnerabilities and manual updates can become a concern (Safe, 2023).

- *GitHub Actions*
    - Leverages GitHub’s built-in security for credentials and secrets, but organizational policies might need extra configuration (Dinu, 2024).
    - Integrates with GitHub’s branch protection rules, PR checks, and secret management (Safe, 2023).

## 6. Use Cases

### When Jenkins Shines
- *Complex Environments*: Large enterprises with advanced build requirements and plugin usage (Safe, 2023).
- *Non-GitHub VCS*: Jenkins can integrate with various version control systems, making it more versatile in certain multi-vsc-repo setups (Dinu, 2024).
- *Complete Customization*: Organizations that want to control every aspect of their CI/CD pipeline on their own hardware (Safe, 2023).

### When GitHub Actions Shines
- *GitHub-Centric Teams*: Projects already hosted on GitHub that want minimal overhead (Dinu, 2024).
- *Simplicity and Speed*: Developers seeking a quick start with YAML-based workflows (Safe, 2023).
- *Parallel Builds*: GitHub Actions supports matrix builds for running tests or builds across multiple configurations simultaneously (Dinu, 2024).

## 7. Key Differences in Summary

| Criterion               | Jenkins                                                          | GitHub Actions                                            |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| *Hosting*            | Self-hosted only (servers or containers)                         | Default GitHub-hosted, optional self-hosted runners       |
| *Setup*              | Manual install and plugin management (Safe, 2023)                | YAML-driven; minimal setup if repo is on GitHub (Dinu, 2024) |
| *Cost Structure*     | Open source but pay for underlying infra (Dinu, 2024)            | Free tier for public repos; usage-based for private (Safe, 2023) |
| *Extensibility*      | Vast plugin ecosystem (Safe, 2023)                                | Large and growing marketplace of Actions (Dinu, 2024)     |
| *Learning Curve*     | Higher due to Groovy pipelines and plugin complexity (Safe, 2023)| Usually lower (Dinu, 2024)                                |
| *Scalability*        | Manual scaling of executors and servers (Dinu, 2024)             | Auto-scales with GitHub runners; self-hosting optional    |
| *Security*           | Must manage updates, plugins, and vulnerabilities (Safe, 2023)   | Leverages GitHub’s security ecosystem (Dinu, 2024)        |

## 8. Conclusion

Both *Jenkins* and *GitHub Actions* are powerful CI/CD tools, each with distinct strengths:

- *Jenkins* excels in customizability and broad plugin integration, making it a solid choice for large or varied infrastructures (Safe, 2023).
- *GitHub Actions* provides seamless GitHub integration, lower maintenance overhead, and a generous free tier for smaller projects, but can become costly at scale (Dinu, 2024).

Ultimately, the “best” tool depends on your project’s requirements, the team’s familiarity with either Groovy or YAML, and whether you prefer hosted versus fully self-managed infrastructure. Understanding these trade-offs can guide an informed decision that aligns your pipeline with your organizational context (Safe, 2023; Dinu, 2024).
