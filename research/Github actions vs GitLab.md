# Comparison of GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD

## Introduction
These CI/CD tools are chosen for comparison because they are the most popular at the moment. Searching in Google for CI/CD they are the first tools that show up as search results.
In CI/CD, both GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD are powerful tools for automating development workflows. 
While they share similarities, their differences make each better suited to particular scenarios. 
This paper compares the two tools based on deployment strategies, pipeline configuration, runners, marketplace availability, integration, cost, and security. 
The analysis draws on sources from DuMez (n.d.) and Felix M. (2023).

## Deployment Strategies
This point is chosen because both CI/CD tools have a very different approach to deployment. This matters if a company or the developers have an idea of deployment plan in mind. Below are the differences are explained. 
GitLab CI/CD has built-in support for advanced deployment strategies such as canary, blue-green, and rolling updates. According to Fernandez (2024), canary updates, also known as canary deployments, involve releasing software updates to a small user group initially before broader release. Blue-green testing is a deployment strategy that uses two identical environments, "blue" (current version) and "green" (new version), to allow seamless updates by directing traffic to the green environment only after successful testing and to ensure an easy rollback if issues arise (Codefresh, 2025).Rolling updates are a deployment strategy that gradually replaces application instances with updated versions, allowing parts of the system to be upgraded, monitored, and tested incrementally without causing downtime or disrupting users (Silverman, 2024).
These features are available out-of-the-box, which is ideal for teams that frequently implement complex deployment patterns (Felix M., 2023). Here it can  be stated that GitLab CI/CD simplifies workflows and reduces the need for multiple tools compared to GitHub Actions, where developers must either write custom code or rely on third-party actions to implement deployment patterns like those mentioned earlier.
On the other hand, GitHub Actions offers flexibility and a large ecosystem of reusable workflows, but manually configuring deployment strategies requires additional effort or community-created Actions (DuMez, n.d.).

## Pipeline Configuration
This point is chosen since it's important for the team that will use the CI/CD tool. Gitlab is stricter with clear stages and build in linting while github actions is modular and flexible.
Pipeline configuration is the root of CI/CD workflows. GitLab CI/CD uses YAML files stored in a **.gitlab-ci.yml** file at the root of the repository and includes a built-in CI Lint tool to validate configurations. (Felix M., 2023).

On the other side, GitHub Actions relies on YAML files in **.github/workflows**. While GitHub does not provide an official built-in lint tool, you can employ third-party utilities (e.g., *yml2dot* or others) to visualize or validate these workflows (DuMez, n.d.). 
This approach still gives developers clarity but may require a bit more set-up.

Both platforms offer flexibility in pipeline configuration, but they differ in structure and practices. GitHub Actions workflows are referred to as jobs, which can be grouped and executed in different orders using dependencies and conditional statements (Schroeder, 2024). This allows for separation of concerns, such as creating distinct build and deployment jobs within a single workflow or across reusable workflows for modularity.

In GitLab CI/CD, pipelines are structured around stages, which group related jobs together. This allows for more granular control, such as requiring a single approval gate for all jobs in a stage. While GitHub Actions does not natively support a "stage" concept, workflows can emulate this using job dependencies and naming conventions (Colin, 2024).

## Supported Runners
This point is chosen because developers have different environments. Some use Windows other Linux and knowing what works with what they have is important since if they choose the wrong one they wont be able to work with it.
Both tools support major operating systems, but there are differences:

- **GitLab CI/CD**: Offers stable Linux runners and provides macOS and Windows runners in beta (Felix M., 2023).  
- **GitHub Actions**: Provides stable runners for Linux, macOS, and Windows (DuMez, n.d.).

Teams that need mature support for Windows or macOS will find GitHub Actions a bit more production-ready. Conversely, GitLab CI/CD’s runners still cover all three platforms, albeit with some features in beta.

## Marketplace/Plugins
This point is chosen because some developers prefer to use pre-built solutions or resources rather than creating everything from scratch. This approach saves time, effort, and resources, allowing them to focus on the unique aspects of their projects. 
GitHub Actions and GitLab are very different in this aspects

- **GitLab CI/CD**: Does not have a dedicated “marketplace” but provides flexibility for scripting custom jobs in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (Felix M., 2023).  
- **GitHub Actions**: Boasts a vast community-driven marketplace of reusable “Actions,” which saves developers time when automating common tasks (DuMez, n.d.).

## Integration
This point is important because it highlights how GitLab and GitHub CI/CD are seamlessly incorporated into their own ecosystem. Depending on the developers here a choice can be made. A team that is more familiar with Gitlab will choose Gitlab CI/CD instead of learning Github Actions only for the CI/CD capabilities and vise versa.
Each tool integrates closely with its respective platform:

- **GitLab CI/CD**: Integrates  with GitLab’s ecosystem, including security scanning, artifact management, and a single interface for issues, code, CI, and deployments (Felix M., 2023).  
- **GitHub Actions**: Integrates natively with GitHub features such as pull requests, issue tracking, and GitHub Packages. For teams that already depend on GitHub, Actions streamline workflows (DuMez, n.d.).

## Cost
Cost is an important point because it shows which companies can afford to use it. A small company would like to save as much money as possible. A big company with resources is ready to overlook that since finances aren't a problem.
Therefore Cost models influence which CI/CD tool is chosen:

- **GitHub Actions**: Free for public repositories, while private repositories incur usage-based fees (minutes and storage). Heavy usage leads to higher bills, though GitHub offers some free monthly minutes on paid plans (DuMez, n.d.). Beyond the free minutes and storage, GitHub Actions imposes charges for any usage that exceeds included limits. By default, monthly-billed accounts have a spending limit set to $0 USD; organizations must increase this limit to enable further usage of private repositories (GitHub, 2025). Standard GitHub-hosted runners incur different per-minute charges depending on the operating system—e.g., Linux jobs cost $0.008 USD per minute, while Windows jobs cost $0.016 USD per minute (GitHub, 2025). Storage overages are calculated daily at $0.008 USD per GB and billed at the end of each month (GitHub, 2025).

- **GitLab CI/CD**: Similarly, GitLab offers a certain number of free compute minutes on its tiers—400 minutes per month for the Free plan, 10,000 minutes per month for Premium, and 50,000 minutes per month for Ultimate. Once users exceed their included minutes, GitLab charges $10 for each additional 1,000 compute minutes (GitLab, 2025). Extra storage can be purchased for $5 per month for every 10 GiB, and users can also explore specialized add-ons such as GitLab Duo Pro or GitLab Duo Enterprise for advanced AI features (GitLab, 2025).

## Security
This point is important because it is a critical aspect of any CI/CD tool, directly influencing the reliability, compliance, and integrity of development workflows. Developers and organizations need to trust that their CI/CD processes are secure.
Therefore, the security features of these tools influence which CI/CD platform is chosen:

- **GitLab CI/CD**: Allows protected variables, exposed only to specific branches or tags, adding a layer of control and preventing unauthorized access (Felix M., 2023).  
- **GitHub Actions**: Uses repository-scoped secrets, letting teams finely tune access based on repository permissions. This integrates well with GitHub’s broader access controls (DuMez, n.d.).

## Conclusion
Both GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD are well made CI/CD platforms with complementary strengths:

- **GitLab CI/CD** is used with teams that want advanced deployment features out-of-the-box and tight integration within the GitLab suite.  
- **GitHub Actions** stands out with it's robust marketplace, stable runners on all major platforms, and native integration with GitHub itself.

Which one to choose depends on existing platform investments (GitHub vs. GitLab), desired deployment strategies, and budgetary constraints.
